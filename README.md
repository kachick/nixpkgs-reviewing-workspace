# nixpkgs-reviewing-workspace

[![Dev Shell Status](https://github.com/kachick/nixpkgs-reviewing-workspace/actions/workflows/devshell.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/kachick/nixpkgs-reviewing-workspace/actions/workflows/devshell.yml?query=branch%3Amain+)

## Motivation

Checking the build result of nixpkgs in multiple platforms is an annoying task.

- I basically do not use macOS these days and only have an old and slow Intel MacBook.
- Having few devices or smartphones if I am walking.
- Several packages are very heavy to build, they take a long time and require many resources.

Solution

- GitHub Actions are free for pricing in public repositories. 😋

## Matrix

As I understand that, Which github provided runner matches the Nix supported [systems](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-24.05/lib/systems/flake-systems.nix).

Excluding no extra runner as _large_. Which cannot be used in free plan.

| Nix            | GitHub       |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| x86_64-linux   | ubuntu-24.04 |
| x86_64-darwin  | macos-13     |
| aarch64-darwin | macos-15     |
